# Use the library utils

There is a a set of utilities or packages used with the package that, since they are already here I encourage you to use if you find them useful.

To used them require them as

  ```js
    var util = require('runtime/lib/utils');
  ```
  - util.Error is [herro.Herror](https://github.com/stringparser/herro)
  - util.argv is [minimist](https://github.com/substack/minimist)
  - util.prettyTime is [pretty-hrtime](https://github.com/robrich/pretty-hrtime)
  - util.requirem is [requirem](https://github.com/stringparser/requirem)
  - util.through is [through2](https://github.com/rvagg/through2)
  - util.debug is [utils-debug](https://github.com/stringparser/utils-debug)
  - util.type is [utils-type](https://github.com/stringparser/utils-type)
  - util.whech is [whech](https://github.com/stringparser/node-whech)
  - util.boil is not a package yet, [go a look at it](https://github.com/stringparser/runtime/blob/master/lib/utils.js#L34)
  - util.merge is just a simple pass by reference merge.
